              I come from a small town in the north-east part of Italy,
              namely Conegliano Veneto in the province of Treviso, roughly
              80km above Venice. This quiet village takes its popularity
              from the worldwide success of Prosecco wine, which vines
              decorate the surrounding hills, softening the valleys that lead
              to Dolomiti mountains.

            <p class="home-par" id="infantry">
              With bumps and bandaging I managed to survive the earliest and
              carefree period of life, culled by the supervision of people who were
              responsible for my actions and BOY, I made use of that power. <br>
              Loving parents, who provided for me with their best whenever
              possible and with their impossible, when it'd worsen. I spent
              most of my days with my mother, from which I took lineage and
              customs.
            </p>
            <p class="home-par" id="youth">
              I joined the <a href="http://www.isgalilei.edu.it">same high school</a>
              that my father attended, 40 or some years prior, but with a twist:
              I would have done Electronics and Telecommunications instead of Mechanics.
              <br>
              The choice proved fruitful, given the still raising demand for such
              a skillset, completed with fundamentals of chemistry as well as
              mechatronics. Through hands-on practice I developed my critical
              thinking and problem solving techniques, which I used to lead and
              give voice, in the role of student representative for two years.
              In particular, I remember the struggle to introduce WiFi technologies
              across the campus, the endless discussions on the effect of a
              new span of frequencies on the students bodies and brains. Together
              with my colleagues, we devised testing to compare the existing
              exposition to radiations (e.g. CB radio for truck drivers), showing
              the exponentially lower danger caused by the newcomer, compared to
              its benefits.<br>

              My father's and my degree, now with me, differ by 6 points and
              he really never digested it. <br>

              He used to come watch my football matches, hoping and gulping
              with me. He was also the father of my step-sister, a
              heart-warming mother with South-American origins. He is
              unfortunately not with us anymore.
            </p>
            <p class="home-par" id="maturity">
              I always thought I was made for something different. Despite
              the inherent familiarity of spaces and seasons I grew up in,
              I realized I was part of something bigger, I realized how small
              I was in my own world and how little I knew about it. <br>
              The unrest grew on me after my first job, I was controlled rather
              than guided, scolded whenever possible, pushed to maximize efficiency
              and never took seriously. Observing more experienced co-workers,
              taking all that very same abuse for granted, turned me sour. <br>
              At the first chance I took up a second job, collected enough money
              to move away and started speaking about it. Fearing the shame of
              a failed departure (I relied on this feeling, actually), after 6
              months I moved to the Netherlands.

            <p class="home-par" id="arrival">
              Stepping out of my comfort zone felt necessary at that point,
              I could no longer rely on other people to feel inspired and loved
              so I sought for new places where my heart would feel home. <br>
              It felt natural to pick the capital city, Amsterdam, as the
              ground and sky to wrap my ideas. I had the chance to visit the city
              twice before then, firstly with my mother and its running team, during
              the 2012 Amsterdam Marathon and few years later with a friend, on a whim.
              While the first time I often stepped aside to admire the uninterrupted
              landscapes, framing clouds and their colors, running after them as
              the wind blew them away, the second journey aimed to discover
              the vibrant lifestyle of a metropoly and its culture. It was during
              this later adventure that I felt a strange familiarity with Amsterdam:
              my mind was at ease, my feet had new grounds to walk on, yet I knew
              the path.

              Along with their development, I learned the importance of <br>
